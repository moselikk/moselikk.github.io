## Demo

## Note

In default, this jekyll theme **don't** offer:

- syntax highlighting styles
- social sharing functionalities
- comment module
- etc.

It's just a static jekyll theme, nothing else.

Layouts and font families are optimized for **Chinese characters**.



## If you don't have a jekyll site yet.

1. Create a jekyll project: https://jekyllrb.com/
2. Copy everything in this directory, paste into your project path, override all the existing files
3. Update `_config.yml` to your own settings
4. Start to write new posts with `markdown` in `_posts` directory



## If you already have one

1. Backup your project
2. Copy everything **but** `_config.yml` in the directory, paste into your project
3. Add your own plugins and functionalities into it
